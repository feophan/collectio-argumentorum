## Assumption:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">Adjectives form dual.</aside>

### Argument:

<Steps>
1. adjectives are inflected for number
    <Evidence>
    >In Quenya attributive adjectives are inflected for number only, if they precede their nouns.
    
    <span class="justify-self-end">\[PE21/77\]</span>
    </Evidence>
2. no evidence that dual is excluded from <span class="text-xl">②</span>
3. **Therefore** adjectives inflect for dual
</Steps>

## Extra-assumption:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">Adjectives form dual on <b>-u</b>.</aside>

### Argument:

<Steps>
1. adjectives have the same inflections as nouns
    <Evidence>
    >Adjectives were not distinguished inflexionally from nouns in Eldarin.
    
    <span class="justify-self-end">\[PE21/77\]</span>
    </Evidence>

    + ? It only means that they had no distinct inflections of their own; not that they necessarily followed the inflections of nouns to a tee.
2. dual on **-t** was like partitive plural, plural on **-u** was like general plural
    <Evidence>
    >The element ū was in most ways parallel to plural ī
    
    >Originally they \[-ta, -tta\] could only appear in nouns, and were distinguished from the others in function, being a parallel to the partitive or indefinite plural

    <span class="justify-self-end">\[PE21/73\]</span>
    </Evidence>
3. adjective agrees with nouns in partitive plural on general plural
    + *nótime eldali*, *ondolisse morne*, **not** *nótimáli*, *mornali*
4. **Therefore** adjectives agree with nouns in dual on **-u**.
