## Proposition:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">If both possessive suffix and the plural marker <b>‑i‑</b> occur, the marker goes first.</aside>

### <Counter index='1'/> Evidence:

<Evidence>
>This \[ī\] was added to the stem direct, and since it preceded the addition of any other affixes, as those for 'case', it was probably the oldest element.

<span class="justify-self-end">\[PE21/72 and others\]</span>
</Evidence>

#### <Counter index='✘' type='con'/> Counter-argument:

As it speaks of CE, the possessive suffixes are **not** part of the list of 'other affixes'.

### <Counter index='2'/> Evidence:

<Evidence>
*híniryannar*, *hildinyar*. \[VT44/33, PE17/103\]
</Evidence>

#### <Counter index='?' type='con'/> Counter-argument:

This word can be with stem *híni*- or pluralia tantum.

### <Counter index='3'/> Evidence:

<Evidence>
*lucindillomman* and similar (VT43/20) of singular *lucindo* that is not an **-i stem**.
</Evidence>

#### <Counter index='✘' type='con'/> Counter-argument:

Due to the suffix order *case-possession*, the example does not in fact support that **-i-** would precede in reverse order. 

## Counter-proposition:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">A noun with possessive suffix inflects as a new noun, with plural marker <b>‑i‑</b> following the possessive suffix.</aside>

### <Counter index='1'/> Evidence:

<Evidence>
*mánte* 'their hands', likely from **mā-nta-ī** (PE17/161).
</Evidence>
