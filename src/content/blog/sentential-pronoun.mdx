## Proposition:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">The sentential pronoun *ha* was discontinued by 1960s.</aside>

### <Counter index='1'/> Evidence:

<Evidence>
>The horses of the Rohirrim are good (are they not \[lit. *is it true*\]). To which the answer is *ná*, *nása*, it is a fact (= yes), or *nár* (*naitie*), they are (indeed = truly).

<span class="justify-self-end">\[PE22/166\]</span>

Thus within the scope of LVS14 *ha* does not exist, as it would need to be used instead of *nása*.
</Evidence>
