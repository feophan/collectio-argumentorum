## Proposition:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">Adjectives form dual.</aside>

### <Counter index='1'/> Evidence:

<Evidence>
>Adjectives were not distinguished inflexionally from nouns in Eldarin.

<span class="justify-self-end">\[PE21/77\]</span>
</Evidence>

#### <Counter index='?' type='con'/> Counter-argument:

It only means that they had no distinct inflections of their own; not that they necessarily followed the inflections of nouns to a tee. 

### <Counter index='2'/> Evidence:

<Evidence>
>In Quenya attributive adjectives are inflected for number only, if they precede their nouns.

<span class="justify-self-end">\[PE21/77\]</span>

And in fact, no clarification that it shouldn't be the case for dual is made.
</Evidence>

## Extra-proposition:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">Adjectives form dual on <b>-u</b>.</aside>

### <Counter index='1'/> Evidence:

<Evidence>
An adjective agrees with partitive plural as general plural: *nótime eldali*, *ondolisse morne*, **not** *nótimáli*, *mornali*. But the same is true for verbs and pronouns, which don't have a separate agreement for partitive plural. The relation of partitive plural to general plural was described to be similar to the (initial) relation between **-u** and **-t** duals.
