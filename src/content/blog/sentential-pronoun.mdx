## Assumption:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">The sentential pronoun *ha* was discontinued by 1960s.</aside>

### Argument:

<Steps>
1. The sentential pronoun was not used in the triggering environment:
    
    <Evidence>
        The horses of the Rohirrim are good (are they not \[lit. *is it true*\]). To which the answer is *n치*, *n치sa*, it is a fact (= yes), or *n치r* (*naitie*), they are (indeed = truly).
        
        <span class="justify-self-end">\[PE22/166\]</span>
    </Evidence>
        
        Thus within the scope of LVS14 *ha* does not exist, as it would need to be used instead of *n치sa*.

2. **Therefore** it was discontinued
