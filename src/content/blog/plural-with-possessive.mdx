## Assumption:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">If both possessive suffix and the plural marker <b>‑i‑</b> occur, the marker goes first.</aside>

### Argument 1:

<Steps>
1. ī historically preceded other affixes
    <Evidence>
    >This \[ī\] was added to the stem direct, and since it preceded the addition of any other affixes, as those for 'case', it was probably the oldest element.
    
    <span class="justify-self-end">\[PE21/72 and others\]</span>
    </Evidence>

    + ✘ As it speaks of CE, the possessive suffixes are **not** part of the list of 'other affixes'.
</Steps>

### Argument 2:

<Steps>
1. ī is attested to precede other affixes:
    + *híniryannar*, *hildinyar*. \[VT44/33, PE17/103\]
        + ✘ This word can be with stem *híni*- or pluralia tantum.
    + *lucindillomman* and similar (VT43/20) of singular *lucindo* that is not an **-i stem**.
        + ✘ Due to the suffix order *case-possession*, the example does not in fact support that **-i-** would precede in reverse order. 
</Steps>

## Counter-assumption:

<aside class="bg-sky-500 p-6 rounded-lg text-white">A noun with possessive suffix inflects as a new noun, with plural marker <b>‑i‑</b> following the possessive suffix.</aside>

### Argument:

<Steps>
1. ī is attested to follow other affixes
    + *mánte* 'their hands', likely from **mā-nta-ī** (PE17/161).
